# GameXMania
A website for downloading PC games. I worked as a Front-End Developer for designing the nostalgic experience. 
- It was live 2 years ago with this Front-End UI (Now its domain name and Front-End UI has been changed. You can visit to [`Games X Mania`](https://www.gamesxmania.com) to download your favourite PC games).
- Developed the Front-End using HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

## Features

- **Nostalgic UI**: CD Case like Game Library cards, when user hover it shows game's studio name and a circular CD, as in previous times gamers used to buy CD to install the game on their PC (but now everything is online and CD buying experience is just limited to Console players only).

- **Modern UI**: If gamers are bored they can switch back to modern UI for current look and feel standards.

## Fun Fact

This was my 3rd Semester Project, I did the Front-End part while my school friend did the Back-End.
